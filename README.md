# 5 DevOps Concepts

### Version Control Systems
- Track and manage changes to code over time.
- Enable collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase.
- Provide branching, merging, and rollback support (example: Git).

### Containerization
- Packages applications and dependencies into portable units called containers.
- Ensures consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.
- Example: Docker.

### CI (Continuous Integration)
- Automated builds and tests detect issues early.
- Improves code quality and reduces integration conflicts.

### CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)
- Automates the deployment of applications after successful testing.
- Enables quick and frequent releases with minimal manual intervention.
- Reduces deployment risks and increases release confidence.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- Infrastructure is defined and managed using configuration files or scripts.
- Ensures repeatability, versioning, and automation of environments.
- Tools like Terraform or CloudFormation eliminate manual provisioning.
